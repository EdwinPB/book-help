#### Description.
This world is deeply reliant on new technologies, social media, and the automation of many processes we can't imagine. There are still activities that have a sense that can’t be replaced, one of those is reading books. It’s still magic to get a book and completely read it, you feel the satisfaction you did it and you end up with new knowledge and even habits in your life that make it easier. 

The fact is that reading books is valuable and people have been losing this practice, one of the enemies of this activity is social media, people love to get into apps just to show off.
